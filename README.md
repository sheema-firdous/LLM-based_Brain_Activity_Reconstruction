# üß† LLM-Enabled Visual Stimuli Reconstruction using Brain Activity Signals (fMRI)

# Abstract
Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activity bridges Neuroscience and Machine Learning (ML) pursuits. Given the complexity of the image generation pipeline from signals data, this area of research has seen limited attention over the past years, in contrast with other machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) realms. The traditional approaches to the task have seen sub-optimal performance due to the complexity of the task. The current research in the AI domain has evolved with the revolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), outperforming the traditional approaches in every aspect. However, these models have not been fully explored for the task of image reconstruction from brain activity signals. Using an open-source dataset, this study addresses the task by first addressing the research gap in traditional approaches, followed by a novel proposed methodology leveraging a vision-based LLM pipeline. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs for image reconstruction procedures by outperforming the traditional baselines.

## üìä Dataset

We use the **Algonauts 2023** dataset, consisting of aligned fMRI recordings and corresponding image stimuli. Each image-fMRI pair is used to train and evaluate multiple reconstruction pipelines.

## üß† Models Implemented

- **GAN**: Baseline System: A generative adversarial network trained to produce realistic images conditioned on fMRI signals.
- **CNN + Autoencoder**: A traditional approach using convolutional encoders/decoders to address the research gap.
- **Transformer-Based Decoder**: Enhanced architecture using SOTA techniques, a sequence model (with and without attention mechanism) capturing complex spatial dependencies from brain activity.
- **LLM-Enabled Pipeline**: A Vision-LLM-based proposed pipeline, Combining CLIP, BLIP, and Stable Diffusion to generate images via caption intermediates from fMRI inputs.
